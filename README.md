#Ogame-bot

This bot is intended to provide automation for simple tasks in Ogame. At this point the bot should be able to work in all servers.
At the beginning the bot could only build defenses, now it can do a variety of tasks<br />

#Usage:

1 - Install the requirements: <br />
pip install -r requirements.txt <br />

2 - Modify the user-sample.cfg file and rename it to user.cfg <br />

3 - The program also accepts two arguments. the first will override the DefaultMode and the second will override DefaultOriginPlanet <br />

The currently supported modes are: <br />
- overview - logs overview data <br />
- explore - send expeditions and attack nearby inactive players <br />
- attack_inactive_planets - attack nearby inactive players <br />
- auto_build_defenses - build defenses <br />
- auto_build_defenses_to_planet - build defenses to planet x(must be one of your planets) <br />
- transport_resources_to_planet - transport resources from all of your planets to planet x(must be one of your planets) <br />
- transport_resources_to_weaker_planet - transport resources from all of your planets to the planet that has less buldings <br />
- auto_build_structure_to_weaker_planet - Build structure on the weaker planet
- auto_build_structures - Build structures on planets / moons, auto repair & collect ships, auto-buy new day item, 
- auto_research - Research on your homeplanet
- check_hostile_activity : Check for hostile activities & attempt fleet escapes with most resources (slow hostile spy missions are considered as attacks too)

e.g.: <br />

python main.py -m explore - will run the bot on the explorer mode (send expeditions and attack inactive targets) <br />

python main.py -m transport_resources_to_planet planet_name - will transport all resources to the planet_name planet (must be one of your planets) <br />


4 - Have a nice day while the bot takes care of the boring parts =]<br />

#Features:

- Spend Resources on defenses<br />
- Transport resources from all of your planets into one of your planets<br />
- Auto spy inactive players nearby<br />
- Auto attack inactive players nearby<br />
- Send Expeditons<br />
- Overview player info<br />
- Build structures<br />
- Research Technologies <br />

#Update

My ogame account has been banned almost 1 month ago due to using a bot. I had been using the bot for more than a year. It was configured to attack inactive planets 6~8 times a day so I was basically asking for someone to report me. I'll likely take a break for now, I don't have the time and motivation required to continue working on the bot. Maybe in the future I will resume the development and work to make the bot smarter, less detectable and support for python 3. <br />

For the players that have used or plan on using the bot: I still don't think that the ogame team has any reliable tool to detect the use of bots. I think they have to rely on someone manually examining the logs. There will always be the risk of other players reporting you, be careful. <br />

Many thanks to Rafał Furmański(http://rafal-furmanski.com/) for letting me use some snippets of his code (https://github.com/r4fek/ogame-bot).<br />
Rafał Furmański's work was crucial for creating the functions to build defenses, send fleets and fetch galaxy's data <br/>
